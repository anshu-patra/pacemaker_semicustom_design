Inputs without external driver/transition

The following primary inputs have no external driver or input transition set.   
As a result the transition on the ports will be assumed as zero. The            
'external_driver' attribute is used to add and external driver or the           
'fixed_slew' attribute to add an external transition.

  report_summary: generates a summary table including various QoS numbers for 
                  various stages in the flow. This command has to be preceded 
                  with the 'write_reports' command, which creates the QoS 
                  statistics to be used by this command. 

Usage: report_summary [-directory <string>]

    [-directory <string>]:
        specifies the path to the directory where the output data of this 
        command is to be stored
